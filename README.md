# Modeling-Churning-of-Bank-Customers-using-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Customer churn has become an increasing challenge for the banking industry,
where available technology has multiplied the banking options easily accessible to all customers.
This project will focus on identifying the characteristics of banking customers who are more likely
to churn, i.e. close their accounts, for a particular bank. To find out the likely behavior or
a combination of factors that potentially leads to churn,  we applied both supervised and unsupervised
algorithms to model the customer churning process and used the following methods of data analytics:
Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest,
K-means and Clustering.
By identifying the characteristics that can better explain customer churns, banks should be able to increase
their Customer Lifetime Value and be more profitable. Our analysis indicates that age, gender, location,
balance and number of products impact the likelihood of churn and make recommendations for each one.
